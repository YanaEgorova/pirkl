                    <p class="text text--mb">Marina and Alexey implemented the first joint architectural project in 2016. Today, the   projects they have created are settled in Cyprus, France, Lithuania and Ukraine. The Ukrainian tandem became international, successful projects flew apart around the world's magazines.</p>

                            <p class="text text-bold about__box-text">Marina Pirkl, developer:</p>
                            <p class="about__box-quote">We take care of all the tasks: from design to the moment when a person enters a new house.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text text-bold about__text-italic text--mb">Marina, your projects have been implemented in different parts of the world. How did your story begin and what is the secret of a successful tandem with Alexey?</p>
                    <p class="text text--mb">I graduated with a Master's degree from the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, worked in a project responsible organization and created projects in the direction of engineering networks. A few years later, I organized a project bureau in Ukraine. Moved to Cyprus in 2012 and improved my skills via recommendations as a project manager. Implemented the first project with local designers, architects and builders in Cyprus. At the same time, I received a Master's degree in Cyprus business administration school. I decided to cooperate with Alexey to adopt a Ukrainian project to Cypriot  domestic market. In 2016, the first successful joint project was implemented and it all started with this.</p>
                    <p class="text text--mb">There is no secret — we just complement each other greatly. Alexey has his own vision, style. His work is recognized, and we are recommended. My job is to bring projects to life. Optimize the budget, find an approach, solve the client's tasks.</p>
                    <p class="text text-bold about__text-italic text--mb">What architectural project we may call successful?</p>
                    <p class="text text--mb">Realized. Most projects in the architecture and design market remain on paper. The project is extremely difficult to implement without architectural supervision and control at all stages. Therefore, we exclusively take on all tasks: from design till the full implementation. Until the stage when a person can enter a new house, stay alive and enjoy comfort. All our projects in Cyprus (Limassol), France (Nice), Lithuania (Vilnius), Ukraine (Kyiv) are now in process.</p>
                    <p class="text text-bold about__text-italic text--mb">What differs your approach and philosophy?</p>
                    <p class="text text--mb">Many architectural designers often work outside the budget and comfort of the client. On the other hand, we implement projects on a budget size, study the lifestyle and human needs. Our task is to optimize expenses, to make them ergonomically. Make sure that the design doesn't become outdated after a while, and the client also feels comfortable after a few years. We assume these moments. Our projects are not similar to each other, but at the same time, they are known.</p>

                        <p class="about__box-quote">Our task is to optimize costs, perform practicality and ergonomics.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text text-bold about__text-italic text--mb">What are your goals and plans for the near future? What ideas would you like to implement?</p>
                    <p class="text text--mb">We have an idea to implement a rather large development project. We design modern comfy villas with a public sector, a variant of a club village with a friendly district. We have both the construction and architectural parts, we're independent and attract investments for the implementation of our ideas and projects.</p>

                            <p class="about__box-quote">Being honest with yourself is what really matters. I don't just design property. I design a way of life.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="text text-bold about__text-italic text--mb">Alexey, your works are published by the world platforms Archdaily, Mindsparkle, Аrchello. Your interiors win top places in international competitions. What was your first project? Tell your story.</p>
                    <p class="text text--mb">I kept up with the art education, at some point I changed my mind and went to study architecture. Graduated from one of the oldest art academies in Ukraine in Kyiv, received a Master's degree at the Lviv Polytechnic. While still a student, I began working in architectural studios, for the longest time in the studio of Sergei Makhno, then on my own. In general, I've a lot of regular customers, word of mouth works well. Very few people are willing to trust large budgets to strangers. A year or two later, we met with Marina.</p>
                    <div class="about__floating-box">
                        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/suburban-house-royalty-free-image-1584972559.jpg" alt="" class="about__floating-img">
                        <p class="text text-bold about__text-italic text--mb">Your company has already become international. How to take into account the wishes of customers from different countries? What are the features in architecture and design?</p>
                        <p class="text text--mb">The world is very globalized, so the basic wishes are: living room, bedroom, bath. There is a cardinal difference in climate: what is good in Lithuania or the south of France is not at all what is needed in Cyprus. In addition to the climate, there is a way of life, a lifestyle. It is also different. Coming from gatherings on the terrace, ending with basic recordings. My work came to a common denominator and wrote about strength, aesthetics, functionality.</p>
                        <p class="text text--mb">I can call myself a craftsperson. Many say that my profession is creative, but I don't agree. We need to solve a lot of problems, and they are not always directly related to architecture. At home, I don't for myself, not for a beautiful picture, first of all — this is a function. If there is a function, it will be convenient for everyone.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="about__quote-box">
                        <p class="about__box-quote">I perform projects not for myself, not for an attractive picture, but, first of all, for function. If there is a function, it will be convenient for everyone.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text text-bold about__text-italic text--mb">Tell us about your style. What materials do you work with?</p>
                    <p class="text text--mb">A lot depends on the basics. If I come to the site, and there are already brick walls, I will not get away from this material, no matter what is in the renovation of the house. Of course, I prefer to work only with natural materials: stone, wood, metal, concrete. I try to use local materials or nearby ones. And let architectural critics speak about style better.</p>
                    <p class="text text-bold about__text-italic text--mb">What is the most important thing at work?</p>
                    <p class="text about__text-big">It's important not to do something that will be embarrassing. Each project is my face. If I understand that the realization is not going according to plan, I'll do everything in my power to still get back on the right track. Being honest with yourself matters. I don't just design houses. I design a way of life. I want my clients to be pleased to return home, so that they want to spend time there, live, develop.</p>
